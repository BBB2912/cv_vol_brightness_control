# Volume and Brightness Control Using Computer Vision

This project implements a system that allows users to control the volume and screen brightness of their computer using hand gestures. The system uses computer vision techniques with OpenCV and MediaPipe to track hand movements and gestures. The right hand is used to control the volume, while the left hand is used to control the screen brightness. The control mechanism is activated by pointing down the middle finger and deactivated when the middle finger is raised.

## Features

- **Volume Control:** Adjust the system's volume using your right hand. The volume is mapped to the distance between your thumb and index finger.
- **Brightness Control:** Control the screen brightness using your left hand. Similar to the volume control, the brightness is mapped to the distance between your thumb and index finger.
- **Gesture Activation:** The control is activated when the middle finger is pointed down and deactivated when the middle finger is raised.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Uses real-time video feed from the webcam for gesture detection and processing.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language used for this project.
- **OpenCV:** Used for real-time computer vision tasks, including capturing and processing video frames.
- **MediaPipe:** Utilized for hand detection and tracking to capture gestures.
- **NumPy:** Used for efficient numerical computations, including mapping distances to volume and brightness percentages.

## How It Works

1. **Hand Tracking:** The system uses MediaPipe to detect and track the positions of the hand and its key landmarks.
2. **Gesture Recognition:** The distance between the thumb and index finger is calculated to control the volume or brightness. The system checks the state of the middle finger to toggle the control mechanism.
3. **Volume and Brightness Mapping:** Using NumPy, the distance between the thumb and index finger is mapped to a percentage that corresponds to the volume or brightness level.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/volume-brightness-control.git
   cd volume-brightness-control
2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required Python packages:
  
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy screen-brightness-control

3. **Run the Project:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
## Usage

1. **Launch the Script:** Run the Python script to start the system.
2. **Control Volume:** Use your right hand to adjust the volume. Bring your thumb and index finger close to decrease the volume or move them apart to increase it.
3. **Control Brightness:** Use your left hand to adjust the screen brightness in a similar manner.
4. **Activate/Deactivate Control:** Point down the middle finger to start controlling, and raise it to stop.

## Future Enhancements

  ->Add support for additional gestures to control other system settings.
  ->Improve gesture recognition accuracy for different lighting conditions.
  ->Create a GUI to display real-time feedback of the volume and brightness levels.
